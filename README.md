# Shelter
One of my first original platformer game, along with a level editor made from scratch that I'm very proud of :3

I made this game as my first tryout of tilemap systems, and level editors.. I was just recovering from tutorial hell (let's ignore the fact that I fell into a bigger one after this :P), so I tried to wrack my brain and make all these systems however I saw fit, regardless of how messy the code was

I added a 2 player mode, so I could play the game with my brother, along with a few tools for trolling him xD .. The controls on that may seem wonky, but it was intended only as a fun little add-on


DISCLAIMER:

I wasn't big on making assets, so I used pictures of Minecraft blocks from the internet.. I don't expect there to be any copyright issues or trouble, but in case there is, please contact me (comment on this page) and we can sort it out
